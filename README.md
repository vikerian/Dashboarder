# Dashboarder
Dashboard for home use with dynamic informations 

- Whole project is written as learning/fun 
- Nothing guaranteed here, if you want guaranteed things, find another :)
- For now sticking to docker compose, in future planning kubernetes deployment (except dbs)
- This is "top" level of parts used in project, it compose everything together. 
Every pkg will be available in it's own repository. No i don't plan hide anything, except my real setup creds,
sorry guys no simple way to hack this in my home for ya :)
